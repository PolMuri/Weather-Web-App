# The search functionality in this application is designed to be user-friendly and flexible:

-Case Insensitivity: The search box is not case-sensitive. This means that you can enter search terms in either uppercase, lowercase, or any combination, and the results will be the same. For example, searching for "Barcelona", "barcelona", or "BARCELONA" will all yield the same results.

-Accent Insensitivity: The search also ignores accents. You can type city names with or without accents, and the application will recognize them correctly. For instance, searching for "M√°laga", "Malaga", or "m√°laga" will all return the same result.

This ensures that users can find the city they are looking for without worrying about exact capitalization or accents.

## In May 2024, we have updated our integration with the OpenWeatherMap API from version One Call API 2.5 to version One Call API 3.0.

This update brings along a series of significant improvements that benefit both our platform and our users

In addition to the update to version 3.0 of the OpenWeatherMap API, we have also incorporated the OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API into our platform. This API allows us to convert geographical addresses into geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) and vice versa, expanding the geolocation capabilities of our platform and enhancing the accuracy of our location-related services.
